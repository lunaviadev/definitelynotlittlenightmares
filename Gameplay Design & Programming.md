<!-- TODO: Confirm topics with Maggie -->

Your development commentary must detail your individual input to the project, the research conducted and its application. Your research must be centred around answering **ONE** of the following questions:
1. What are the different ways in which the experience of immersion has been theorised, and which theorisation, if any, is most relevant to video games? Draw on relevant scholarship and your analysis of appropriate video game examples.  
2. Will video games inevitably mature into a new narrative artform driven by their storytelling ambitions? Consider different narrative structures deployed by game designers and the player’s role in experiencing and constructing game stories.  
3. What does it mean to approach a video game from a ludological standpoint, and should theories relating to rules, games, and play be central to the analysis of video games?  
4. How does the design of video game space affect the actions and experiences of players? Consider how different game spaces have been categorised in the literature and concepts of space and place discussed in the lecture.  
5. What are the key similarities and differences between the formal aspects of the video game and film? And, what can the answer to this question tell us about the relationship between them? Consider aspects like narrative and the concept of remediation covered in lecture six. 
6. Are all video games essentially simulations that give players a new degree of control over media texts, or does considering the medium through the concept of simulation suggest it has the power to train their players to behave in certain ways?
