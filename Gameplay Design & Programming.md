## Project Outline (Suggested Word Count 500) 

- For this project I aim to create a near replica of a Little Nightmares II (LITTLE NIGHTMARES II | Official Website (EN), 2021) area that faithfully emulates and recreates the style, feel and gameplay of the source game. The core concept of the project is to have 3 main rooms in which the player progresses through, completing small physics based puzzles whilst fending themselves off from an array of enemies in order to solve the room's larger puzzle and ultimately break out ad escape the facility they are trapped in. The purpose of this project is to highlight my abilities as a developer to faithfully recreate gamestyles and present a workflow that would be industry standard whilst providing proof of my prowess as a developer to use in my personal portfolio. 

- The initial goals for this project are to faithfully recreate the feel and mechanics of Little Nightmares II due to its successes as a narrative horror that provides the player with an original and unique form of storytelling as they progress through the meticulously crafted world of Little Nightmares II. Little Nightmares II is one of the most successful in it's genre selling over 1 million copies in its first month on the market (Little Nightmares II reaches 1 million units sold! | Bandai Namco Europe, 2021) marking it as one of their highest grossing games. For reasons such as these, using Little Nightmares to base my project off and recreate their gameplay style and storytelling through environment would be one of my primary goals. Secondarily, I would like to be able to implement their fundamental mechanical systems faithfully, such as the flashlight that is used to stun enemies in the game, and the enemy tracking / chasing systems that define the series. 

- When it comes to the challenges I'll momst likely face during my time developing the project, adjusting to working in Blueprints and Unreal in general will most likely be my biggest challenges. Given that Blueprints and Unreal are vastly different to enginges I have worked in before and languages I have programmed in, my biggest learning curve will be getting used to programming primarily in Blueprints and using C++ to support my blueprint work. Futhermore getting enemy AI to work as intended may provide a significant challenge
