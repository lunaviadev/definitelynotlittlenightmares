## Brief

My Question I will be answering:

- Will video games inevitably mature into a new narrative artform driven by their storytelling ambitions? Consider different narrative structures deployed by game designers and the player’s role in experiencing and constructing game stories.  




## Project Outline 

 For this project I aim to create a near replica of a Little Nightmares II (LITTLE NIGHTMARES II | Official Website (EN), 2021) area that faithfully emulates and recreates the style, feel and gameplay of the source game. The core concept of the project is to have 3 main rooms in which the player progresses through, completing small physics based puzzles whilst fending themselves off from an array of enemies in order to solve the room's larger puzzle and ultimately break out ad escape the facility they are trapped in. The purpose of this project is to highlight my abilities as a developer to faithfully recreate gamestyles and present a workflow that would be industry standard whilst providing proof of my prowess as a developer to use in my personal portfolio. 

 The initial goals for this project are to faithfully recreate the feel and mechanics of Little Nightmares II due to its successes as a narrative horror that provides the player with an original and unique form of storytelling as they progress through the meticulously crafted world of Little Nightmares II. Little Nightmares II is one of the most successful in it's genre selling over 1 million copies in its first month on the market (Little Nightmares II reaches 1 million units sold! | Bandai Namco Europe, 2021) marking it as one of their highest grossing games. For reasons such as these, using Little Nightmares to base my project off and recreate their gameplay style and storytelling through environment would be one of my primary goals. Secondarily, I would like to be able to implement their fundamental mechanical systems faithfully.

 When it comes to the challenges I'll most likely face during my time developing the project, adjusting to working in Blueprints and Unreal in general will most likely be my biggest challenges. Given that Blueprints and Unreal are vastly different to enginges I have worked in before and languages I have programmed in, my biggest learning curve will be getting used to programming primarily in Blueprints and using C++ to support my blueprint work. Futhermore getting enemy AI to work as intended may provide a significant challenge. 

## Research 

### Methodology  


Going into the project, my main methodology for creating, designing and replicating the feel of little nightmares was to take a level from the base game that is as close in feel and setting to our desired project. In my case this is the school level from Little Nighmares 2. (Chapter 2: School- Complete Walkthrough - With Collectibles and Hats | Little Nightmares 2, 2021) I watched a video of the classroom level in its full to gain an idea for how I wanted to format the general mechanics, vibe and playstyle of the level. With my main takeaways from the watching session being that I wanted to create a more stealth based level that makes use of suspenseful moments and makes use of various elevations to play with perspective and scaling of the world around the character. To gain further insight I then researched and looked into an interview with Dave Mervik of Taiser Studios (Creating Little Nightmares, 2022) in which he goes into depth about the creation of Little Nightmares and its design philosophy. After reading the interview my main point was that they heavily valued was creating atmosphere and ensuring that the mood and feel of the level design matched the "Nightmare fuel-esq" art direction of Little Nightmares. This meant that having a blockout and mechanics that heavily reflected which I briefly mentioned in my project outline which was the stealth based gameplay and the heavy emphasis on precision platforming and physics based puzzles.

To ensure that the final project fulfils my vision, I will conduct user testing, gather feedback and then do repeat playtests with non team members to gain valuable criticisms and futher develop my project to be closer to an official Little Nightmares expansion.

### Game Sources  

Building further on my last segment, Little Nightmares and Little Nightmares 2 are my core game sources that I used to influence all my decisions and design choices when it comes to my own personal project. Scanning through a variety of interviews done by the Taiser Studios team I was able to gain a deeper understanding of how their game philosophy and design all pieced together to create a final project like Little Nightmares II. (Little Nightmares - Andreas Johnson & Dave Mervik Interview, 2016) Andreas Johnson focuses in on how background elements and subtle environmental details heavily contributes to how the overall story of Little Nightmares is percieved, this level of detail and interactivity contained within a story is something only achieveable in the media of games, highlighting specifically why it is so important to tell stories in this media and to allow them to be recognised as their own kind of artform. 

Furthermore, looking in on an interview for the upcoming Little Nightmares III (Little Nightmares III – Producer Interview | Bandai Namco Europe, 2023) that releases later this year talks about how Little Nightmares is a "unique style of horror, we call it charming horror" highlighting how Taiser Studios strives to create a different horror experience. I aim to achieve a similar kind of feeling with my own project, honing in on that unique horror aspect that is commonly exampled throughout the Little Nightmares series. 



### Academic Sources  
- Research academic papers, books, or articles that provide theoretical guidance for your project. Include a brief summary of each source.  
- Describe how the academic research applies to your project and shapes your design and development decisions.

When analysing my approach from an academic standpoint, I turned to 'The Medium of Video Games' (The Medium of Video Games | Mark J.P. Wolf, 2001) to aid my understanding of what allows a vide game to trascend it's base inspirations of movie and boardgames to its own expansive art form. Turning to page 93, we understand that as graphics and technology evolved, so did the stories that were told throughout video game history. Mark notes that video games started as merely another form of entertainment, arcaic in nature and simplistic in execution. Though looking to the modern day, games like The Last of Us are pushing expectations of what it means to be a video game, using its narrative and storytelling to surpass the quality of many movies at the time, quickly raising to the top of charts and dominate the space. 

### Documentation Sources  
- Investigate relevant documentation, tutorials, or instructional videos that provide technical insights into your tasks. Summarise the content and its relevance to your project.  
- Explain how this technical knowledge supports your project work and guides your decision-making process.

## Implementation (Suggested Word Count 1,100)  

### Process
- Provide a step-by-step breakdown of your development process, including key milestones and decisions made throughout the project.

- Explain why these approaches were chosen and how they differ from standard practices.  
- Evaluate the success of these approaches, including any challenges faced and lessons learned.

### Testing
- Document the user testing conducted, specifying the type of tests used (e.g., automated testing, guided user testing, blind testing).  
- Present feedback or issues identified during testing, using graphs, tables, or visual aids to summarise results.  
- Describe how these issues were addressed. If any issues were not resolved, provide a clear justification for leaving them unaddressed.

### Technical Difficulties
